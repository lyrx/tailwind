Alexander Weinmann offers a wide range of consulting services related to technical issues in IT.
IT inspires him to think about various aspects
(far beyond the "technical" realm) both professionally and personally.

For over 25 years, he has dedicated his work to refining his skills in the IT industry.
To this day, he remains fascinated by the endless possibilities that IT offers.

His journey began as a student assistant at SAP AG Walldorf. Today, he offers his consulting
services as the managing director of lyrx GmbH.

Alexander believes his greatest strength lies in his versatility. Whether it's developing innovative
solutions to improve customer service or leading teams in the complex world of IT, he always brings
100% of his personality into his work.

His area of interest occasionally shifts, and currently, it lies (not surprisingly ðŸ˜€) in AI.
