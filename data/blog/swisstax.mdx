I am not a tax expert, but like everyone else, it's interesting for me to understand as much as possible about the tax system of the country in which I live -- in my case, Switzerland.

I also have a passion for software development, so it's natural for me to try to translate as much as I understand about tax calculation into code.

The Swiss tax is composed of three parts, each of which can be related to different regions in Switzerland.

The **federal tax** is a uniform tax levied across the entire country.

The **cantonal tax** is levied by the individual cantons into which Switzerland is divided. The cantons roughly correspond to the federal states in Germany.

Each canton is in turn divided into municipalities, and each municipality levies its own **municipal tax**.

Let's start with the **federal tax**. It is defined via a [table](https://www.estv.admin.ch/dam/estv/de/dokumente/dbst/tarife/58c-2023-dfi.pdf.download.pdf/58c-2023-dfi.pdf) that I found in a PDF format, which is difficult to evaluate automatically. Therefore, I've taken a slightly different approach to understand the calculation of the federal tax at least partially with Javascript means:

I use the **parameter triplet**: `[TaxableIncomeIntervalStart, BaseTax, IncrementPer100]`. I can easily extract this triplet from the table. `BaseTax` is the federal tax that must be paid if one's own taxable income is exactly `TaxableIncomeIntervalStart`. `IncrementPer100` denotes the amount that must be added to `BaseTax` for every CHF 100 that one's own taxable income exceeds `TaxableIncomeIntervalStart`.

This triplet is now passed as the parameter `tarife` to the following function:

```js
function(Income,tarife){
        const TaxableIncomeIntervalStart = tarife[0]
        const BaseTax = tarife[1]
        const IncrementPer100 = tarife[2]

        const remainder = Income - TaxableIncomeIntervalStart
        const taxRemainder = (remainder / 100) * IncrementPer100

        return BaseTax + taxRemainder
    }

```

*Finally, a small prize question: Why is the function overly precise?* -- The answer is helped by a bit of mathematics.[^1]

[^1]: `(remainder / 100)` probably needs to be rounded up to an integer.
