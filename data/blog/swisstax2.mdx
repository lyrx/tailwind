In the [first part](swisstax), it was about the Swiss **Federal Tax**. Now it's about the
**Cantonal Tax** and the **Municipal Tax**.

In this context, there is often talk of the **tax rate**. This is a relative value that differs
from canton to canton and from municipality to municipality. But equally important is the
absolute value to which this *tax rate* refers. However, this absolute value also varies from canton to canton.

It's the **simple state tax** ðŸ¥µ.

I finally found the numbers for the
**simple state tax**
in the
[Cantonal Sheets](https://www.estv.admin.ch/estv/de/home/die-estv/steuersystem-schweiz/kantonsblaetter.html).
If we take the values for 2023 from the cantonal sheet for the canton of Zurich, we can write:

```js
const basicRate = [
        [0,  6700], // 0% for the first 6700
        [2,  4700], // 2% for the next 4700
        [3,  4700], // Same as above
        [4,  7600], // Same as above
        [5,  9300], // Same as above
        [6, 10700], // Same as above
        [7, 12400], // Same as above
        [8, 16900], // Same as above
        [9, 32500], // Same as above
        [10,32200], // Same as above
        [11,51000], // Same as above
        [12,66200], // Same as above
        [13,254900] // 13% for income parts over 254,900 CHF
    ]
```

For calculating the **simple tax**, we then write this simple function:

```js
function calculateStateTaxZurich(income, basicRate) {
        return basicRate.reduce(([tax, remainder], [percent, amount]) => {
            let taxable = Math.min(amount, remainder);
            return [tax + taxable * (percent / 100), remainder - taxable];
        }, [0, income])[0];
    }
```

(*Here, the basic rate is quite elegantly iterated over with `reduce` and a function literal to "collect" the tax burden*. ðŸ˜‰)

However, for the calculation of the cantonal tax, there is also a *calendar year-dependent*
[tax rate](https://www.zh.ch/de/news-uebersicht/mitteilungen/2022/steuern-finanzen/steuern/steuerfuss-fuer-die-jahre-2022-und-2023.html).
In our case, for the canton of Zurich and the year 2023, that's exactly 99% of the simple state tax.

We correct our calculation as follows:

```js
function calculateStateTax23Zurich(income, basicRate, taxRate) {
       const stateTax = calculateStateTaxZurich(income, basicRate);
        return stateTax * (taxRate / 100);
    }
```

Now only the municipal tax with its associated tax rate remains. It gets simpler! We note:

```js
function calculateMunicipalTax(income, basicRate, taxRate) {
       const stateTax = this.calculateStateTax(income, basicRate);
        return stateTax * (taxRate / 100);
    }
```

-- However, finding out the
tax rate for your own municipality is something we deliberately leave to the reader ðŸ˜›.
