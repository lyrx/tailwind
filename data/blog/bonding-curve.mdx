## The Bonding Curve Contract

Ensuring the security and fairness of token trading is paramount.
The **Bonding Curve Smart Contract**, addresses these challenges head-on.
Developed using Solidity 0.8.20 and leveraging OpenZeppelin's robust security frameworks, this contract introduces a
linear token pricing model resistant to common market manipulation tactics like sandwich attacks.

### Key Features

- **Linear Bonding Curve Pricing**: The contract employs a linear increase in token price with each sale, starting
  at 1 ETH and incrementing by 0.01 ETH. This predictable pricing mechanism benefits both new and existing token holders.
- **Slippage Control**: To protect against market volatility, the contract caps slippage at 5%, ensuring transactions
   are executed close to expected values.
- **Buy and Sell Functionality**: Users can easily buy tokens at the current price (subject to a maximum price limit) and sell
  them back to the contract at the current price, ensuring liquidity and user autonomy.
- **Transparent and Secure**: Built with transparency and security in mind, the contract's code is open for review and
  contributions at our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/lyrx/fot).
