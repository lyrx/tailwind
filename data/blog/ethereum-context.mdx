Last time we talked about how to integrate MetaMask into a website,
more specifically, how to use the `window.ethereum` reference.

Now we go one step further and deal with the question
how we can actually use Ethers/MetaMask on a complex React website.

Usually, they are passed as `props` to individual React components. Since these
can be quite deeply nested, this quickly becomes complicated. The problem is called
**prop drilling**.[^1]

Here the
[React-Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)
comes into play. It prevents **prop drilling** and thus enables that
all** subcomponents can directly access context information from a certain node.
can directly access context information.

I have defined the context for this use case as follows:

```tsx

const Context = createContext<EthersContextType>({
  ethersProvider: {
    web3Provider: null,
    web3ProviderSetter: null,
    lastBlock: null,
    lastBlockSetter: null,
    defaultMainNetProvider: ethers.getDefaultProvider('mainnet'),
  },
})

```

Because Typescript is used here (`<EthersContextType>`), it is possible to quickly extend the context
quickly later and benefit from the **type safety** of Typescript.

1. The MetaMask plugin as a component of the browser.
2. `DefaultMainNetProvider` as a component of the *Ethers* library, that is used when no Ethereum Gateway
    has  been found.
3. `lastBlock`, the most recent block in the blockchain.

These are completely different objects in reality, but they are modeled and made available
in a uniform way. Fascinating!

Where that context as a part of reality is needed, it can now be quickly included, such as in this
component:

```tsx
'use client'

import React, { useEffect, useState, useContext } from 'react'
import Context from '../../app/context/Context'
import { ethers } from 'ethers'

const CurrentNetwork: React.FC = () => {
  const context = useContext(Context)
  const [network, setNetwork] = useState<ethers.Network | null | undefined>(null)
  useEffect(() => {
    context?.ethersProvider?.web3Provider?.getNetwork().then((n) => setNetwork(n))
  }, [context?.ethersProvider?.web3Provider])
  return network ? <span>{network?.name}</span> : <span>`--`</span>
}

export default CurrentNetwork
```

This is a densely packed piece of code, but it benefits from the compactness that
possible with **TypeScript**. If the **Context API** was not used,
it would look much wilder and more complicated at this point. With
a little basic knowledge of React, the code remains readable.

If you would like to learn more about this, you are welcome to
[here](https://github.com/lyrx/tailwind/blob/main/app/context/ContextProvider.tsx)
to have a look.

All that remains to be said is that anything is possible if you want to
Ethereum and React together. You just have to know how to do it ...

[^1]: As always in software development, every extension harbors the risk
that the application becomes increasingly complicated. **Prop drilling** is one
example of this.
So what to do? -- The
[React-Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) is only
one solution for this. There are also many other context APIs for React,
but these must be integrated as external components. The React context
has the advantage that it is already included.
