I have been working as a freelance IT consultant for a long time and have always billed by the hour.

Gradually, I feel that this time should be over. Hourly billing is neither fair to a customer who expects a result,
nor to the freelancer who would actually like to work result-oriented and satisfy the customer.

Often, the work package is not clearly defined, and then the customer does not get what he really wants,
and the freelancer is forced to bill hours without being able to deliver a meaningful result. This is in no one's interest.

Now that I am very intensively dealing with the Web3 area, it becomes even clearer to me that a rethinking is indicated here.

Therefore, in the future, I want to offer billing based on a piece of work to be created.
Often it is at least clear to the client what he needs to generate added value in his business.
Where it is not entirely clear to him how to implement this technically, he can commission this clarification.
Where he  has no clarity at the business level, he can commission an analysis for this.
The consultant delivers and is paid on the basis of his delivery.

The value of the service then arises directly from the achievable added value for the customer.
Billing on an hourly basis is no longer necessary. It comes from the last century.
It fits into a time when the work result could be read one to one from the effort.

But when was that really ever the case?
