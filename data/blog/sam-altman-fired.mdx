Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, has been removed from his position.

What now becomes of OpenAI's goal to develop "General Artificial Intelligence" for the benefit of all humanity?
This goal has always sounded like it was taken from a technologically devout science fiction novel from the
sixties of the last
century.

With such utopian goals, we should always ask ourselves whether humanity is
perhaps once again guided by animal instinct.
Even now with OpenAI?

A dangerous tool is currently getting out of control at OpenAI.
This sends shivers of
horror down my spine, to be honest.

Humans have always used their
tools for military purposes and for evil! This was the case with stone tools two and a half million years ago. It is still the case today.

And now, the seemingly ethically influenced OpenAI is collapsing like a house of cards...

How naive people are when it comes to human readiness for
ethical behavior! These are the same people who otherwise think very rationally and sensibly.

Where is the reason now? For or against OpenAI?
