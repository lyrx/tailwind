Yesterday and today I worked on a small demo that is supposed to build a bridge between
Web3 and Scala.

Scala is of course not the programming language that is standard in Web3. It is definitely Javascript/Node.JS,
as is the case in so many use cases today.

Scala is extremely complex,  it offers  many fancy features for programmers. This makes the language interesting, elegant
and perhaps particularly suitable for larger projects. We find a lot here that developers at
Ethereum and Javascript are sorely lacking. A good type system etc.

But the learning curve with Scala is quite steep, and therefore not so suitable for beginners. Those who
inexperienced can easily get bogged down in the many language features.

Anyway, I have something
[simple on Github](https://github.com/lyrx/infura) now,
and my confession is still the same: **I love Scala**.
