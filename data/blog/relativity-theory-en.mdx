### Space in Three Dimensions

We usually perceive what we call *space* in three dimensions:
length, width, and height. This simply means that three numbers are needed
to uniquely describe a point in space.

$$
x = (x_1,x_2,x_3)
$$

This trio of numbers is commonly referred to as the *spatial coordinates* of a point, and
we define the distance between two points as follows:

$$
\Delta{}x = \sqrt{ (x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + (x_3 - y_3)^2 }
$$

From this, we derive the velocity $v := \Delta{}x / \Delta{}t$, as
we know it from school, where $\Delta{}t$ is the time that passes
while the distance $\Delta{}x$ is covered.

### The Concept of Space Since Einstein

Einstein used a different concept for the distance between two points:

$$
\Delta{}X = \sqrt{ c_0^2 \Delta{}t^2 - (x_1 - y_1)^2 - (x_2 - y_2)^2 - (x_3 - y_3)^2 }
$$

Here, time is included in the concept of distance. This is precisely what is new and ingenious
about Einstein's special theory of relativity. ($c_0$ is a constant and corresponds to
the speed of light in a vacuum.)

We want to consider this new concept of distance for the case where the spatial distance between the two
points $x$ and $y$ is equal to $0$. This corresponds to the case that we would describe as *standing still* in our everyday life. An object does not move, but remains in place. Then the expression above simplifies to
$$ \Delta{}X = c_0 \Delta{}t$$

If we now define the speed analogously to the above case as $\frac{ \Delta{}X}{\Delta{}t}$,
we get $v_0 = c_0$. The speed of light!

**Remaining at a point corresponds in a relativistic view
to a forced movement at the speed of light. Standing still is no longer possible.**

Something seems not right. Our conventional understanding of speed
is cast in a very different
and strange light ...
