I had the idea to integrate [MetaMask](https://docs.metamask.io/) into this blog,
and this is what [came out of it](/ethereum) ...

Now, I'll briefly and concisely describe how I went about it.

The goal was to use the JavaScript library [Ethers v6](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) to communicate with the Ethereum network.

So, it was about integrating **MetaMask** as a so-called [BrowserProvider](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/#BrowserProvider),
as this is the *key object* through which **Ethers** connects to the Ethereum network.

And how do I now get such a [BrowserProvider](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/#BrowserProvider)?

First, **MetaMask** injects itself into the [DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_htmldom.asp) through
a reference: `window.ethereum`. However, this *proxy object* can also be used by other browser
extensions, e.g., the [Brave Wallet](https://brave.com/de/wallet/) of the [Brave Browser](https://brave.com).

Now that we know how to access **MetaMask** via *JavaScript*, it's just a matter
of building the bridge to [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.org). It's as simple as this:

```js
provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum)
```

And if `window.ethereum` is not set, we set:

```js
provider = new ethers.getDefaultProvider('mainnet')
```

The `DefaultProvider` is a `read-only` implementation of this interface, only intended to enable
a few read accesses to the Ethereum network when no plugin is available in the browser.

So far so good -- so simple! It gets interesting when we want to use **Ethers**, and thus **MetaMask**,
on a real website. But you'll learn about that in the next post.
