Since the beginnings of the digital age, various paths have been taken to generate digital content.
From the early days, $\TeX$ and $\LaTeX$ can be mentioned, pure formatting languages
designed to produce printable and well-formatted text.

Things quickly became
more abstract. HTML was first developed for static web pages. This, in turn, evolved from a
much more complex and general standard, **SGML**, which is no longer relevant today.

With **XML**[^2], for the first time a simpler, yet abstract and very
powerful markup language was developed, capable of
structuring text as well as data for further processing. **XML** was once considered the holy grail, but it was not. Things evolved quickly
from there.

As the first interactive websites emerged,
**JavaScript** became an important programming language for websites.
**JavaScript** had to be standardized quickly, especially its access to the
**DOM**[^3].

In addition, standards like **JSP** and **JSF** appeared, with which websites could be preprocessed on servers. Such standards are long outdated. Nowadays,
the layout for websites is mostly generated in web browsers, i.e., on the computers
of internet users.

The enumeration of past technological approaches could continue for a long time
and would lead from one thing to another. The reader would drown in a sea,
that has long been swum through.

Endless attempts were made. Thus, looking back into the past is like looking
into apparent chaos. Out of this chaos, the (still very complex) **Status Quo**
as we know it today slowly formed. -- However, even this is still constantly changing, becoming more powerful, and expanding.

Remarkably, the old does not completely disappear. A core
has formed that remains and is very durable. **HTML** as the
formal *skeleton* for websites, for example, has remained. **JavaScript** has also stayed
and is still the most commonly used programming language for websites,
widely used and indispensable. This despite the fact that better and
more powerful programming languages have long been developed.

This post is written in **MDX**[^4], and thus based on one of the most
advanced standards for creating internet pages available to us today. It goes far beyond what we could all imagine twenty years ago.

[^2]: The [XML Standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/) is still readable today and
an impressively clear and convincing document of its time.

[^3]: **DOM** refers to the so-called *Document Object Model*, an object-oriented
model for web documents. This also had to be standardized so that it could be accessed with
programming languages
and pages could be uniformly formatted worldwide in different browsers and on different computers.
